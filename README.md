üíª **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Data Ingestion from Multiple Sources:** <br> Import legacy data from various sources (e.g., Excel, SQL Server, Oracle) and load it into a target system. (Utilizes sample databases like AdventureWorks, Northwind, FoodMart). |
| 2 | **ETL Process Implementation:** <br> Perform Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) processes to construct a database in SQL Server. |
| 3 | **OLAP Cube Creation:** <br> Create OLAP cubes with suitable dimension and fact tables based on ROLAP, MOLAP, and HOLAP models. |
| 4 | **Data Visualization with Pivot Tables/Charts:** <br> Import data warehouse data into Microsoft Excel to create Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for analysis. |
| 5 | **Machine Learning for Business Analytics:** <br> Perform data classification using a suitable classification algorithm OR data clustering using a clustering algorithm on a given dataset. |
